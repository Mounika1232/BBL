        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
          players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete
          with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4
          inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18
          inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a
          backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team
          from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two
          points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth
          three.
        </p>
        <h2>Playing regulations</h2>
        <p>
          Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA) or 12 minutes (NBA).
          College men's games use two 20-minute halves,[39] college women's
          games use 10-minute quarters, and most United States high school
          varsity games use 8-minute quarters; however, this varies from state
          to state.15 minutes are allowed for a half-time break under FIBA, NBA,
          and NCAA rules and 10 minutes in United States high schools. Overtime
          periods are five minutes in length except for high school, which is
          four minutes in length.
        </p>
        <h2>Fouls</h2>
        <p>
          An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types
          of physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul. These
          are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be
          committed by offensive players as well. Players who are fouled either
          receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more free
          throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether
          the shot was successful.
        </p>
